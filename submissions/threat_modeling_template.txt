Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Spoofing Identity
    - A user with bad intension can get access and introduce a malicious package or image into the registry.

Tampering with Data 
    - If not use an updated version of the image and have a vulnerability this can be lead to a malicious system exploited

Information Disclosure 
    - By default, all network traffic is allowed between containers on the same host on the default network bridge, this leads to a leak of restricted data like secrets or keys.

Denial of Service  
    - Memory limit is not set by default on docker this can be lead to and massive DOS on the images and make them inaccessible.

Elevation of Privilege 
    - If --privilege flag was not in place this will lead an attacker to get administration or root access to de system and other images containers. 




Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Spoofing Identity
    - Exposing the server to the public could be an entry point for attackers, and allows them to take over the cluster orchestration 

Tampering with Data 
    - The configuration file could be attaked an affect the entire cluster, compromising the system orchestration.

Repudiation
    - TLS need to be enabled all the time to prevent unauthorized changes on the system  

Information Disclosure 
    - Information can be leaked one way to protect the system is to do the communication and store data encrypted at rest. 

Denial of Service 
 - The orchestration of Kubelet can be a subject of DOS 



Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).

[FAIL] 2.2 Ensure network traffic is restricted between containers on the default bridge (Automated)
[FAIL] 5.14 Ensure that the 'on-failure' container restart policy is set to '5' (Scored)
[FAIL] 5.10 Ensure that the memory usage for container is limited (Automated)
